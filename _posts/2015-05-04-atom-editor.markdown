The reason I made this blog is because I want to practice my english writing,
so forgive me if it's not the best. Another reason it's to design in html and
css.
It's always a good idea to have a subject to don't write mumbo jumbo and be
able to write extended text.

Let's start with the subject I chose today:

## Introduction to Atom editor

Currently there a lot of web development tools. Some are very GUI oriented,
WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get), but I have always preferred to use text
editors. There is something that offer more control in coding websites in text
only, besides this way I managed to learn to code them and understand them.

I have always used [vim](http://www.vim.org) as my "goto" editor. It's just an editor, but it's the
most powerful editor I know of.

To change things a little i downloaded [Atom](http://www.atom.io) so I'm going
to write my little experience with this editor.

At a first glance Atom looks beautiful, powerful and very complete. Also it's open-source and I would like that [GitHub](http://www.github.com) to release it
under a [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) license. Thanks to the Atom community have a lot of packages (plugins) to expand it more.

## Atom as a web development IDE

Atom comes with a package already by default called "Markdown Preview" (Referenced in the image) which is very nice. ![markdown preview](/images/markdown-preview.png)
This is very handy for writing posts in blogs effortlessly, but if you're very serious about web development then this is not enough, so I'm going to list all the packages I've installed in Atom to create, at this moment, my personal blog.

### Atom packages

#### Color-picker
This package is to be used when writing in [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) language and what it does is open a popup window to let you choose colors based on your css color code.

#### Atom-html-preview
This package open a new tab with a preview of your html+css+js code. Like shown in the image. It refreshes it automatically once open so makes it very easy to use.

###Â¢ Atom-color-highlight
A great package that display the colors of the css color code in code.

#### Emmet

One of the greatest plugins for any text editor. Emmet (Formerly zen coding) It makes web development remarkably easy. With some simple keystroke you can create an entire website without the hustle of typing every markup tag.

For example:

Instead of typing the whole html like this

``<div id="someID" class="someClass"></div>``

In emmet you type **div#someID.someClass** and you get the same result!.

#### date
Date is just a package that put a timestamp anywhere you want. I've installed it, because sometimes I wanted to put the date and time in the posts.

## Conclusions

Atom is a nifty editor and very customizable. It's still in development, but I don't care, I'm going to use it anyway because I liked it very much.

Good bye and take care.
